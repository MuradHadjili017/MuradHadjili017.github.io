    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello — I’m <strong>Murad Hadjili</strong>. I am a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at ADA University with a strong academic interest in artificial intelligence, engineering, and design. I am currently focused on building a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical technical skills.</p>

    <h2>Current focus</h2>
    <p>At this stage of my education, I am developing beginner-level experience in: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Git &amp; GitHub</strong>, and <strong>VS Code</strong>. Through continuous practice and coursework, I aim to strengthen these skills and apply them to real-world engineering challenges.</p>

    <h2>Experience &amp; values</h2>
    <p>Beyond technical skills, I value problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork. I have gained practical experience through participation in engineering and robotics competitions, where I learned how to work efficiently under pressure and transform ideas into functional solutions.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>In the future, my goal is to become a highly successful engineer by combining strong engineering principles with modern technologies such as artificial intelligence. This SITE 1101 course plays an important role in my academic journey by helping me understand the fundamentals of web development and digital project creation.</p>
