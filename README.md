# Personal Website — Murad Hadjili

This is my personal website created as part of a university course project.

## About
I am a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at ADA University with interests in artificial intelligence, engineering, and design.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of web development and create a functional personal website using modern tools.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## Projects
- Robotics competition achievements (SAF & FLL)
- Space debris recycling startup concept
- Personal website project

## Live Website
https://murdhadjili017.github.io

## Add or replace profile photo
A placeholder SVG is included at `images/profile.svg`. To use your own photo:

- Add your image to `/images` and name it `profile.jpg` or `profile.png` (or replace `profile.svg`).
- Recommended size: at least 800×800px for good quality; the site will scale it down responsively.

## Notes for instructors and reviewers
- Code is intentionally simple and documented for beginner readability.
- Accessibility considerations: semantic HTML, keyboard-navigable menu, aria attributes for the mobile menu, and readable color contrasts.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` if you use that)
3. The site will be available at `https://murdhadjili017.github.io` (this repo is configured to publish from the `main` branch)
