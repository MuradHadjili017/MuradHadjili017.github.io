# SITE 1101 — Individual Project

This repository contains the SITE 1101 Individual Project for Murad Hadjili. It is a simple, responsive personal website with a Home, About, and Projects page. The required project is the "Accessible Portfolio" on the Projects page.

## Files
- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About page
- `projects.html` — Projects page (contains the mandatory project)
- `css/style.css` — Styles (mobile-first, responsive)
- `js/script.js` — Small JavaScript for navigation and utilities

## Preview
Open `index.html` in your browser or deploy to GitHub Pages to see the site.

## Notes for instructors and reviewers
- Code is intentionally simple and commented lightly for beginner readability.
- Accessibility considerations: semantic HTML, keyboard-navigable menu, aria attributes for the mobile menu, and readable color contrasts.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` if you use that)
3. The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>` or at your username root if you use a `username.github.io` repository.

## License
You can add a license file if you wish. This project is for educational use.
